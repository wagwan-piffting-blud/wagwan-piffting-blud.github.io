I host a proper website at <a href="https://wagspuzzle.space/">Wags' Puzzle Space</a>. You're probably looking for that.

If not, I have a couple smaller projects on my GitHub pages, including:

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://wagwan-piffting-blud.github.io/mecmap/">Mirror's Edge: Catalyst Map</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://wagwan-piffting-blud.github.io/EAS-Tools/">EAS (Emergency Alert System) Tools</a></li>
</ul>

Otherwise, visit my main site for more info about me and what I do. Thanks!
